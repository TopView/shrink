## This is a simple GNU/Linux command line tool to resize images.  

* It can resize individual images, or all images in a folder.  
* It can resize them by a percentage or to a fixed bit width
* It creates a new copy, so leaves the orginal untouched.

Usage: (See usage near the top of the 'shrink' program file).
